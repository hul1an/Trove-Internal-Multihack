# Trove Internal Multihack
affectionately named TIM <3

ignore the name of the folder, the scope of the project was originally much lesser

current features:

- silent aim
- super cool imgui gui

yup, thats it...
dont even have esp or anything yet. 
silent aim currently doesnt have any sort of target priority

this cheat really isnt useable rn i'd advise against it tbh, not sure if it would result in a ban from prolonged use.

TODO:
- esp/ visual functions
- speedhack (already done just cba to add it rn)
- speedhack bypass (open source, i am going to skid it >:D)
- different targeting options like bosses only or plants
- release a precompiled dll so randoms can run it lol
- add rat :O

DONEDO:
- added basic gui, more to come ;)
- removed debug console, was slowing everything down


to compile: open in vs2022, set to release/x86, use multibyte character set, language standard c++ 20
